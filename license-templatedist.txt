This package contains the template part of the main binary distribution in order to enable
more frequent updates or patches. These templates are XSLT files to demonstrate code generation
and include import and export templates for UML designers (XMI 1.2 and 2.1 format).

Currently, XMI import and export is only tested with BoUML. See www.bouml.fr for a license.
