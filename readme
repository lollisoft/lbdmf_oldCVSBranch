		    DMF - Distributed Multiplatform Framework
			Copyright (C) Lothar Behrens 2002


This framework was intented to be independend from compiler and vendor frameworks
like MFC or Watcom class libraries. Multiplatform stays currently for Windows and
Linux. More OS systems are welcome, but I am unable to test it.

The part Distributed is currently not integrated, because of my complete rewrite
of my work to use COM like dynamic loading of classes. The part of distributed may
be implemented with a CORBA compilant system and a wrapper class that is configured
local in my system.

Generally I write a pure abstract class (interface) and a corresponding cpp file
implementing the interface. Loading instances from interfaces is dony by a name
of the interface - the identifer of that class it self.

The object repository uses a XML file that configures, which implementation is used
in the current environment. Please pay attention of the different mangling on each
platform. On linux, modify the xml file so that the functor has no prefix (_).
Each interface like lb_I_Container for a container is
configured pointing to a module (DLL/so) and a functor, that creates the instance.


Prerequirements:

Windows:

You need a MSC compiler (only the console tools),
also the Watcom 10.6 or Openwatcom compiler is needed to compile all under Windows,
MKMK.exe - a makefile creation tool to build makefiles that matches to
my make environment, the source is included, so you can bootstrap it.
Unix tools like make (Mingw or the like), a version is also included in the binary distribution
Batchfiles are provided to setup the env variables,
subst a drive Q: pointing to the actual development tree
(subst q: c:\). Then q:\ has the following tree:
q:\develop\projects\CPP\...



Linux:

An actual G++ compiler and all the tools to compile,
mkmk - a makefile creation tool to build makefiles that matches to
my make environment, the source is included, so you can bootstrap it.
uncompress the file to your home directory,
create /libdev/lib (as root) for the so modules and give rigths to you to 
copy the so's to it (my choice for development :-),
place the CPP directory to /home/<user>/develop/Projects
env variables for the bootstrapping:
	MODULELIB=lbModule.so
	LBXMLFUNCTOR=getlbDOMConfigInstance
	LBMODULEFUNCTOR=getlb_ModuleInstance
	DEVROOT=/home/<user>/Develop
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/libdev/lib:
	OSTYPE=linux


Vendor libraries, that are used in my code:

	XML4C C++ XML library:
	Download the matching XML4C distribution for your OS 
	from http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/download/xml4c
	place the extracted tree to /home/<user>/develop/Projects/CPP/vendor/XML4C,
	please attent, that the directory name must match to xml4c-src3_5_1
	build it and install it as usual.
	
Vendor programs, that I have adopted for my need:

	mkmk
	    Build: 
		Goto /home/<user>/develop/Projects/CPP/vendor/dosdir,
		call make.sh
		goto /home/<user>/develop/Projects/CPP/vendor/mkmk,
		call make.sh
		copy mkmk to ~/bin
		
Hint: The mkmk tool was orginally written by Luis Crespo. His publication is at:
