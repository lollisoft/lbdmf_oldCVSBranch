		This file describes some things that should be done in the next time.
		
		I also will discuss some problems while the development stages.

		18.10.2005	DatabaseReport is missing a function to get the value of a replacement.
				The replacement for example is a customer number that will be shown in
				the form, that calls the database report. In the case of custom where
				clauses, the column of the where clause may contain a foreign key and it
				should be shown the representative value of it.
				
				It this case the customer number should be shown. If the database report
				has been called from inside a database form, the form could pass it self
				to the database report as a parent. Given this, the form could ask the
				database form for the correct value, since it has it.
				
				But there will be another case of calling a database report. The application
				could be configured to have a menu entry. In this case there is no form as a
				base.
				
				The best enhancement then would be the extraction of that code, who is
				responsible for getting the values inside the foreign key drop down boxes.
				
				This also could be used inside the database report.

		30.09.2005	Database type int8 from postgreSQL is currently not supported.

			01.10.2005: Added the support. Also detect redadonly columns such
				as aggregated columns (count, avg, ...)

		24.09.2005	If the binary samples downloaded and no database configuration
				has been set up (ODBC setup), the application crashes with a
				NULL pointer exeption.
				
			24.09.2005: 
					Need to create an assistant for ODBC setup,
					need to extend the database classes to support
					with ODBC setup API.
					
			24.09.2005:
					Fallback to a file based configuration. This is in
					work, but no decision has been made.
					
					A first step would be streaming, then syncing with
					the database.

			24.09.2005:
					There may be a bug in the current ODBC driver. Uninstalling
					it and reinstalling the 7.03.0200 driver fails, because the
					old driver isn't uninstalled properly.
					
					This may have to do with the database installer's optional
					ODBC driver installing step. 

		28.08.2005	There is a design problem or a visual problem with foreign key
				values, when they should show names that could appear multiple
				times. In this case it is unclear what the user should select.

				As a sample, the formular_parameters form points to it's formular
				table, in which case the additional information about the application
				is missing.

				There were two solutions for that:

				Show the application at the second name in the drop down list.

				Let the list depent it's values on another dropdown's selected value.
				In that case the selected application. If the application for the current
				entry has been changed, the form value becomes invalid, because the containing
				list of forms has been chaned too.

		26.08.2005	There is a problem with queries, that don't result in data.
				The form then has no result set and probably could not add
				new data.
				
			28.08.2005: Adding works, but the app crashes after adding
				by navigating to any other data. This must be tested a little
				more.

		14.08.2005	Mac OS X:
		
				Debug Malloc functionality should be integrated, if there is anything
				to integrate.
				http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/MallocOptions.html

				There still is a problem with check boxes.
				
				Database scripts:
				
				There is still a bad thing with database model scripts for different
				database systems. Isn't there a solution for it in one file of any
				format ?
		
		09.08.2005	Master -> detail and detail -> master dialogs have been implemented.
				
				Missing functionality are direct update events, if an user select a
				different row in the master dialog (customers for example). The update
				could be fired by pressing the action button after the data has been
				displayed.
		
		27.04.2005	There is a problem in the new configuration dialog, that let the user select
				the correct column to show for a foreign key.
				
				If the table is only, say, a connection table for other entries, the real data
				to be shown would be in the master table of the referred entry.
				
				Slave table
				    Master table to be referrenced by entries of slave table.
				A-> location A
				|
				B-> location B
				|
				C-> location C
				
		19.04.2005	There was a problem with readonly columns and the bound column for it.
				
			19.04.2004 Solution was to shortly unbind the column. -> API enhancement.

		01.02.2005	Problems to port the framework to Mac OS X 10 and hints for solutions found.

			?	Any solution has been found.
		
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Try to compile code under Mac OS X 10 makes some problems. Try with lbHook
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------

				copy lbkey.h from lbclasses directory to the include directory in CPP
	
				export path=$(path):~/bin geht unter MAC OS X 10 nicht ???
				=> makefile.configure: Change @mkmk to ~/bin/mkmk
	
				lbHook.cpp:45: dlfcn.h: No such file or directory ???
				=> found one in /sw/include
	
				lbConfigHook.h:72: malloc.h: No such file or directory ???
				=> found one in /usr/include/sys
				=> Makes this problems with wxWidgets include path ???
	
				cc: cannot specify -o with -c or -S and multiple compilations ???
				=> removed the -o (Possible only in OS X and not in Linux)
			
				/usr/bin/ld: Undefined symbols: ???

		29.01.2005	Database problems and other things
				Found some unimplemented features in the MYSQL database
				engine, or the workaround dows not work.
				
				The database does not support foreign keys in tables not of
				type InnoDB. But I have changed it to these types and while
				creating the tables again, I run into an error message like this:
				
				
				Error
				
				SQL-query : 
				
				CREATE TABLE Formulare(
				id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
				Name VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				MenuName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				EventName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				MenuHilfe VARCHAR( 100 ) ,
				AnwendungID INTEGER,
				Typ INTEGER NOT NULL ,
				PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ,
				FOREIGN KEY FK_AnwendungID( AnwendungID ) REFERENCES Anwendungen( id )
				) TYPE = INNODB
				
				MySQL said:
				
				Can't create table '.\lbdmf\formulare.frm' (errno: 150)
				
				
				Solutions:
				
				I would create the referencing logic at application level, but I haven't
				yet created a general class structure to hide this from normal application
				code.
				
				I still have a table that documents the foreign key column at a specific
				table. It hints to the primary table, wich would be a great help for me to
				only make minor changes in my code.
				
				
				
				TODO: Deactivate the part of reading out foreign keys by SQLForeignKeys.
				Directly use the table from lbdmf. Getting the primary key via SQLPrimaryKeys
				would be working.
				
				Table: ForeignKey_VisibleData_Mapping having these columns:

					(FKName, FKTable, PKName, PKTable)
				
				To handle the additional refferential from one table to primary table, I would still
				have a column PKName, but I store another field to hint to a column to show instead
				the primary key.
