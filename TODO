		This file describes some things that should be done in the next time.
		
		I also will discuss some problems while the development stages.
		
		
		27.04.2005	There is a problem in the new configuration dialog, that let the user select
				the correct column to show for a foreign key.
				
				If the table is only, say, a connection table for other entries, the real data
				to be shown would be in the master table of the referred entry.
				
				Slave table
				    Master table to be referrenced by entries of slave table.
				A-> location A
				|
				B-> location B
				|
				C-> location C
				
				
		19.04.2005	There was a problem with readonly columns and the bound column for it.
				
			19.04.2004 Solution was to shortly unbind the column. -> API enhancement.

		01.02.2005	Problems to port the framework to Mac OS X 10 and hints for solutions found.
		
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Try to compile code under Mac OS X 10 makes some problems. Try with lbHook
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------

				copy lbkey.h from lbclasses directory to the include directory in CPP
	
				export path=$(path):~/bin geht unter MAC OS X 10 nicht ???
				=> makefile.configure: Change @mkmk to ~/bin/mkmk
	
				lbHook.cpp:45: dlfcn.h: No such file or directory ???
				=> found one in /sw/include
	
				lbConfigHook.h:72: malloc.h: No such file or directory ???
				=> found one in /usr/include/sys
				=> Makes this problems with wxWidgets include path ???
	
				cc: cannot specify -o with -c or -S and multiple compilations ???
				=> removed the -o (Possible only in OS X and not in Linux)
			
				/usr/bin/ld: Undefined symbols: ???

		29.01.2005	Database problems and other things
				Found some unimplemented features in the MYSQL database
				engine, or the workaround dows not work.
				
				The database does not support foreign keys in tables not of
				type InnoDB. But I have changed it to these types and while
				creating the tables again, I run into an error message like this:
				
				
				Error
				
				SQL-query : 
				
				CREATE TABLE Formulare(
				id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
				Name VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				MenuName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				EventName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				MenuHilfe VARCHAR( 100 ) ,
				AnwendungID INTEGER,
				Typ INTEGER NOT NULL ,
				PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ,
				FOREIGN KEY FK_AnwendungID( AnwendungID ) REFERENCES Anwendungen( id )
				) TYPE = INNODB
				
				MySQL said:
				
				Can't create table '.\lbdmf\formulare.frm' (errno: 150)
				
				
				Solutions:
				
				I would create the referencing logic at application level, but I haven't
				yet created a general class structure to hide this from normal application
				code.
				
				I still have a table that documents the foreign key column at a specific
				table. It hints to the primary table, wich would be a great help for me to
				only make minor changes in my code.
				
				
				
				TODO: Deactivate the part of reading out foreign keys by SQLForeignKeys.
				Directly use the table from lbdmf. Getting the primary key via SQLPrimaryKeys
				would be working.
				
				Table: ForeignKey_VisibleData_Mapping having these columns:

					(FKName, FKTable, PKName, PKTable)
				
				To handle the additional refferential from one table to primary table, I would still
				have a column PKName, but I store another field to hint to a column to show instead
				the primary key.
