This file describes some things that should be done in the next time.

I also will discuss some problems while the development stages.

24.06.2012	Using a test machine I have determined the following steps that
		are required to get the source code compiled:

		Compiling from CVS: Get the latest code (opt. from a branch),
		optionally touch the Makefile in CPP/BaseDevelopment (it may be
		required due to the case it is older than some makefile.module
		files that are used to create makefiles per target / module.
		Especially do touch if you encounter corrupted makefiles.
		Download unixODBC with at least in version 2.2.12, compile and
		install it to /usr/local. change into the CPP/BaseDevelopment
		directory and call . environment-osx.sh (with dot and space).
		Then type make.

17.06.2012	Compiling unixODBC as a universal binary is not possible within
		one build step using configure & make & install. The C preproces
		sor is used and this creates errors about no support for
		multiple architectures. Testing this with a hello world app
		showed why: Assembler code is at least one cause.
		A solution is documented here: 
		
		http://acaro.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/
		using-configure-to-build-macos-universal-binaries/

16.06.2012	Compiling my application on Snow Leopard and running on Leopard
		is not possible. There will be an error message in dylib trying
		to load a module. The error is like this: unknown required load
		command 0x80000022.
		
		A hint about the issue is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1738401/libtiff-3-dylib-unknown-required-load-command-0x80000022
		Or here: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3481337&group_id=129302&atid=714418

29.05.2011	I have a big issue with releasing phase. It takes always too long to get a release to the public.
		The cause are too many manual steps in building, deploying and testing. There must be a better solution
		for this. Some info from my todays chat protocol:

		dpkg: gsimmons wants you to know: from memory, etch sources.list is "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free" and "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security 
		etch/updates main contrib non-free".  But realise that Etch has not had security support since February 2010 and that you should upgrade to a newer release.  Ask me about <etch->lenny>.
		dpkg: Release Notes for Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (Lenny) are at http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/releasenotes .  See also http://bugs.debian.org/release-notes and 
		http://wiki.debian.org/NewInLenny. Also ask me about <i-g>, <installer firmware>, <etch->lenny key>, <lenny errata>, <squeeze release notes>.

		lothar: Hi, I have a Etch (PPC) and experience to not find some packages in the last time. apt-get update returns some errors (404). How to fix/reset to uptodate repositories?
		gsimmons: dpkg: tell lothar -about etch sources.list
		gsimmons: lothar: Consider updating your system to Lenny when convenient.
		chealer: lothar: are you aware that etch is no longer supported?
		lothar: Yes I plan it.
		lothar: chealer: Oops. Then I should update to the newest version.
		lothar: Does upgrading a running Etch work or is a fresh install the better way?
		lothar: Are there any sources about implementing an automated setup (with info on an USB stick for sampe)?
		chealer: lothar: what do you mean by an automated setup?
		lothar: Things like a detailed instruction how to setup a box without interaction, but I do support that list. It is more seen in the enterprise to deploy hundreds of machines. Another 			sample is using the setup to create test instances for software rollout. Imaging would be a later issue I think. I would avoid the error-prone manual setup for future installs and like to 			save time.
		dba: lothar: look at preseeding as described in the appendix of the debian installer manual
		dba: lothar: for creating the media, you might want to use debian-live + live-installer (part of d-i)
		gsimmons: lothar: WRT upgrading, provided you follow the procedure in the release notes (/msg dpkg lenny release notes), this should be straightforward.
		lothar: Ok, thanks - I'll have to RTFM some manuals :-)
		shirish: hi all, does anybody know of a manpage where the Debian contents files and how/what they should be like is explained. 
		shirish: by debian contents files I mean something like  http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/Contents-amd64.gz
		shirish: also does anybody know where are they put in when running apt/apt-get or/and aptitude ?
		nevyn: the list files?
		nevyn: /var/lib/apt/lists/
		shirish: nevyn: thank you. btw do you know of any manpage or any documentation anywhere which tells about the InRelease files and how they are made up. 
		nevyn: nope.
		nevyn: it might be in the reference guide tho.

22.09.2008	There are some remaining problems with sqlite based databases when opening
		the 4th detailform over a master detail action. The problem is that there
		are unexplainable database lock I was not yet capable of fixing by holding
		the database statements as short as possible open.

		The problem currently only occurs on Windows, but not on Mac. Other platforms
		are not tested yet.

		To avoid this behaviour, the form that could not be filled with data, should
		be filled with a dummy entry if only that form is open. 

07.07.2008	Instance messaging tested with tcpdump tracing on port 5222 and 5223. There
		was some communication, but it didn't came to me.
		Try to record the raw communication. Another test.

		There was a logfile I have overseen :-)
		Also there was an authentication error. Retry.

		At all it was the authentication problem. Again got a message.

01.06.2008	Improve Cruise Control integration.
		
		Instant messaging works from now on.

16.04.2008	Creating Sqlite Database script in usual way fails due to unsupported ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT.
		Solution could be parsing these statements and separate the step of creating foreign keys to an
		internal subsequent statement. While parsing them the statements could be rewritten to be triggers.
		Additional metadata could be created to enable logical extraction of foreign key information.

14.04.2008	Importing XMI 2.1 formatted files are working, but complete application logic transfer
		to a new database does not work. There are missing three steps:

		1. In the table column_types is missing ro boolean column.
		2. No user account has been created.
		3. Type of dynamic database formular must be created in table formulartypen.

		ODBC library path settings should be taken from odbc_config.

		Shell scripts for setting um environment under Mac OS X does still not work.

01.04.2008	Testing package on a newly installed Mac OS X.
				
		There are any things that are not working without manual steps:
				
		Must call environment-osx.sh to get OSTYPE and some other environment
		variables.

		Download unixODBC and do the following steps:

		./configure --enable-gui=no     (If no Qt libraries are installed)
		make
		make install

		The configure script does set the prefix to /usr/local, so I may change my
		prefix for the required libodbc.dylib file.

		CVS source code version needs to get wxWidgets from anywhere.
		On Mac it is still the wxMac 2.6.2 version.

		Build the wxWidgets library with the following options:

		./configure --enable-monolithic=yes --enable-shared=yes
		make
		make install

		After installing the library, you need to remove the created dylib files in
		output directory of the wxWidgets library. Do not make clean.

		Add /usr/local/bin to the path variable to enable access to wx-config, if
		the prefix has not been changed.

		The environment-osx.sh script does not really work. Do a cat and copy paste
		the commands.

		The documentation for the Mac OS X system must be written in the API doc.

		The Sqlite library didn't get cleaned and installed nor build. It is propably
		not in the target list.

		Sample.r in vendor/wxaui-0.9.1/sample is missing.

03.12.2005	DatabaseForms lack to handle proper adding of data in an empty table.
		The form does not update the entered data after 'Add' has been pressed.
		There must be added a second row. Then manipulating rows will work.

18.10.2005	DatabaseReport is missing a function to get the value of a replacement.
		The replacement for example is a customer number that will be shown in
		the form, that calls the database report. In the case of custom where
		clauses, the column of the where clause may contain a foreign key and it
		should be shown the representative value of it.
				
		It this case the customer number should be shown. If the database report
		has been called from inside a database form, the form could pass it self
		to the database report as a parent. Given this, the form could ask the
		database form for the correct value, since it has it.
				
		But there will be another case of calling a database report. The application
		could be configured to have a menu entry. In this case there is no form as a
		base.
				
		The best enhancement then would be the extraction of that code, who is
		responsible for getting the values inside the foreign key drop down boxes.
				
		This also could be used inside the database report.

30.09.2005	Database type int8 from postgreSQL is currently not supported.

		01.10.2005: Added the support. Also detect redadonly columns such
		as aggregated columns (count, avg, ...)

24.09.2005	If the binary samples downloaded and no database configuration
		has been set up (ODBC setup), the application crashes with a
		NULL pointer exeption.
				
24.09.2005
		Need to create an assistant for ODBC setup,
		need to extend the database classes to support
		with ODBC setup API.
					
24.09.2005
		Fallback to a file based configuration. This is in
		work, but no decision has been made.
					
		A first step would be streaming, then syncing with
		the database.

24.09.2005
		There may be a bug in the current ODBC driver. Uninstalling
		it and reinstalling the 7.03.0200 driver fails, because the
		old driver isn't uninstalled properly.
					
		This may have to do with the database installer's optional
		ODBC driver installing step. 

28.08.2005	There is a design problem or a visual problem with foreign key
		values, when they should show names that could appear multiple
		times. In this case it is unclear what the user should select.

		As a sample, the formular_parameters form points to it's formular
		table, in which case the additional information about the application
		is missing.

		There were two solutions for that:

		Show the application at the second name in the drop down list.

		Let the list depent it's values on another dropdown's selected value.
		In that case the selected application. If the application for the current
		entry has been changed, the form value becomes invalid, because the containing
		list of forms has been chaned too.

26.08.2005	There is a problem with queries, that don't result in data.
		The form then has no result set and probably could not add
		new data.

28.08.2005	Adding works, but the app crashes after adding
		by navigating to any other data. This must be tested a little
		more.

14.08.2005	Mac OS X:
		
		Debug Malloc functionality should be integrated, if there is anything
		to integrate.
		http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/MallocOptions.html

		There still is a problem with check boxes.
		
		Database scripts:
				
		There is still a bad thing with database model scripts for different
		database systems. Isn't there a solution for it in one file of any
		format ?
		
09.08.2005	Master -> detail and detail -> master dialogs have been implemented.
			
		Missing functionality are direct update events, if an user select a
		different row in the master dialog (customers for example). The update
		could be fired by pressing the action button after the data has been
		displayed.
		
27.04.2005	There is a problem in the new configuration dialog, that let the user select
		the correct column to show for a foreign key.
				
		If the table is only, say, a connection table for other entries, the real data
		to be shown would be in the master table of the referred entry.

		Slave table
		Master table to be referrenced by entries of slave table.
		A-> location A
		|
		B-> location B
		|
		C-> location C
				
19.04.2005	There was a problem with readonly columns and the bound column for it.
		
		Solution was to shortly unbind the column. -> API enhancement.

01.02.2005	Problems to port the framework to Mac OS X 10 and hints for solutions found.

		?	Any solution has been found.
		
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Try to compile code under Mac OS X 10 makes some problems. Try with lbHook
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------

		copy lbkey.h from lbclasses directory to the include directory in CPP
	
		export path=$(path):~/bin geht unter MAC OS X 10 nicht ???
		=> makefile.configure: Change @mkmk to ~/bin/mkmk
	
		lbHook.cpp:45: dlfcn.h: No such file or directory ???
		=> found one in /sw/include

		lbConfigHook.h:72: malloc.h: No such file or directory ???
		=> found one in /usr/include/sys
		=> Makes this problems with wxWidgets include path ???
	
		cc: cannot specify -o with -c or -S and multiple compilations ???
		=> removed the -o (Possible only in OS X and not in Linux)

29.01.2005	Database problems and other things
		Found some unimplemented features in the MYSQL database
		engine, or the workaround dows not work.
				
		The database does not support foreign keys in tables not of
		type InnoDB. But I have changed it to these types and while
		creating the tables again, I run into an error message like this:
				
				
		Error
				
		SQL-query : 
				
		CREATE TABLE Formulare(
		id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
		Name VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
		MenuName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
		EventName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
		MenuHilfe VARCHAR( 100 ) ,
		AnwendungID INTEGER,
		Typ INTEGER NOT NULL ,
		PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ,
		FOREIGN KEY FK_AnwendungID( AnwendungID ) REFERENCES Anwendungen( id )
		) TYPE = INNODB
		
		MySQL said:
				
		Can't create table '.\lbdmf\formulare.frm' (errno: 150)
				
		
		Solutions:
				
		I would create the referencing logic at application level, but I haven't
		yet created a general class structure to hide this from normal application
		code.
				
		I still have a table that documents the foreign key column at a specific
		table. It hints to the primary table, wich would be a great help for me to
		only make minor changes in my code.
				
				
			
		TODO: Deactivate the part of reading out foreign keys by SQLForeignKeys.
		Directly use the table from lbdmf. Getting the primary key via SQLPrimaryKeys
		would be working.
				
		Table: ForeignKey_VisibleData_Mapping having these columns:

			(FKName, FKTable, PKName, PKTable)
			
		To handle the additional refferential from one table to primary table, I would still
		have a column PKName, but I store another field to hint to a column to show instead
		the primary key.
